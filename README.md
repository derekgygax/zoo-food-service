# Zoo Food Service

This is the **Food API** for managing food-related data in the zoo management system. Built with **FastAPI**, it handles operations such as food records, storage unit records, food location units allowed, and which foods certain animals can eat. It is part of a larger microservices-based architecture for zoo management.

---

## Features

- CRUD operations for food.
- Management of storage units, and food location units, and which food animals can eat.
- Integration with a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL).
- Role-based access control (RBAC) with JWT authentication.
- API documentation via Swagger UI and ReDoc.
